[![CI Pipeline for API & UI Tests](https://github.com/NikolaNovosel/TestAutomationFramework/actions/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NikolaNovosel/TestAutomationFramework/actions/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml)

The business layer consists of the app interface (POM), business logic, and validation. The Pages object model (Business/ApplicationInterface) contains logic for locating DOM elements and performing actions on them. The validation class (Business/Validation) contains validation methods, while the context (Business/Context) part implements a higher level of abstraction for page interactions. I also added a Model directory in the Business layer. In the Core layer, besides using DriverSingleton as a browser factory, I also created a Factory directory to implement the Factory design pattern. Additionally, I practiced different parameter selection methods here, as I used a DriverKind enum in the Factory browser and a generic type for the DriverSingleton. I also added Api directory in the Core layer, containing all classes implementing the Builder design pattern to configure REST requests. The Core layer includes a Data directory that provides test parameters and configuration data. There is a Helper directory in the Core layer containing a DriverKind enum, a TestUtils class (which handles logging, screenshots and other utilities methods), and an AboutHelper method (logic used for Business/Validation). The Tests layer contains test classes designed to validate both UI and API functionality.
